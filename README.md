# Taxee

----------

#### Your friendly neighborhod income tax data and calculation API.

This repository contains the source code for the Taxee API.  The hosted version of this API can be found on [taxee.io][1], and documentation on the API endpoints can be found there.

This API is written in PHP and utilizes the [Slim Framework][2].  The data that drives Taxee (the tax data) is contained in static JSON files.  The GET requests detailed on [taxee.io][3] simply serve this static data.  The PUT request (the calculation endpoint) consumes some of this static JSON data, and then performs a few minor calculations on it.

## Usage

 1. [Install][4] the `composer` PHP dependency management tool.
 2. Checkout this repository
 3. Run ``` php composer.phar install``` to install the PHP dependencies.
 4. Start up a PHP server in the directory (Ex. ```php -S localhost:8000```)
 5. If everything went well, you should be able to load up 2014's federal tax data in your browser by going to http://localhost:8000/api/v1/federal/2014
